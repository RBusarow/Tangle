## 0.10.0

Initial release

This release supports multi-bound `ViewModel` injection via the `by tangle()` delegate function,
with Compose support.

Automatic `SavedStateHandle` injection is supported, and arguments can be automatically
constructor-injected via the `@FromSavedState("myKey")` annotation.
